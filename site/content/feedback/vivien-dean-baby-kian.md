Steffi and Katja gave us much needed guidance in the weeks after the birth of our second child. We appreciated tremendously their constant support in our preferences, that they always took the time during each visit to discuss the various topics, and were in general very well organised. We wholeheartedly recommend Yoma Hebamme team.Â Thank you for your support!
