Steffi and Katja gave us tremendous support during those emotional first weeks after our daughter Fiona was born. They brought so much warmth, compassion, and wisdom—often knowing what I needed before I did. Whether it was answering my endless questions, reassuring me when I felt overwhelmed, or simply holding space for my emotions, they were there with such care and presence. I felt safe, seen, and deeply supported. Thanks to them, my postpartum days were not only easier—they were filled with comfort, healing, and the quiet confidence that I could do this.
